Product Dissection for Netflix

Welcome to this case study on dissecting and designing products for Netflix. In this case study, you will delve into the intriguing world of schema design for a prominent platform of your choice.
My task was to choose a top leading platform, research its features, and meticulously craft a schema design that encapsulates the essence of its functionality. By focusing on key entities, attributes, and relationships, you will gain invaluable insights into how data architecture drives the platform's effectiveness.
This project deals about dissecting the key features of Netflix and analysing the problem solving strategies used by Netflic to real world problems faced by them.
This project also inclues schema design where each table is created with their realtionships.
Finally creating an ER diagram to showcase the relationship between them.
